        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a fourth year computer science student at the Illinois Institute of Technology.  
          I was first introduced to coding in middle school and instantly fell in love it.  
          I love spending my free time in a variety of different ways, many of them include: reading, 
          painting/drawing, traveling/going to new places, hanging out with friends and family, solving 
          puzzles, and playing video games.  I grew up being a rhythmic gymnast but also did swimming, 
          figure skating, and ballroom/latin dance for a little bit of time. In high school I joined the 
          the dance team and dance company.</p>
